Simply collaborate.

### What is coNote?

Using ReactJS and Firebase, we hope to provide a lightweight and straightforward collaborative Markdown editor that doesnâ€™t compromise on most of the core features that are available on other collaborative editors.

---
### Motivation
Markdown is a lightweight markup language, designed to create formatted text easily using a plain text editor. It is a very useful tool when you need to write quick notes that look great. In addition, it is currently the go-to markup language in many situations, i.e. writing Reddit posts or GitHub Gists, creating static webpage websites (see [blot.im](https://blot.im/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), writing project documentation (see [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)), etc.

Thus, when used in a team setting, it can result in faster turnover for simple work, whether writing class notes, meeting notes, project blog posts, project documentation, etc. Hence, we decided to create a collaborative Markdown editor. 

Also, it just seems interesting to work on.
